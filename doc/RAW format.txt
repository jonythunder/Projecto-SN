GPS Raw Measurement Data Format (RAW)
ASCII format, one line per message, with the following tab separated fields:

(1) iTOW - Measurement integer millisecond GPS time of week (Receiver Time)
           units: ms

(2) WN - Measurement GPS week number (Receiver Time)

(3) numSV - # of satellites following

The next tab separated fields contain 50 measurement blocks.
Only the first numSV measurement blocks contain valid data.
The remaining measurement blocks contain zeros.
Columns (4..13) contain the first measurement block as described next:

(4) svn - Space Vehicle Number
(5) mesQI - Nav Measurements Quality Indicator
            >=4 : PR+DO OK
            >=5 : PR+DO+CP OK
            <6 : likely loss of carrier lock in previous interval
(6) C/No - Signal strength C/No
           units: dBHz
(7) LLI - Loss of Lock Indicator (RINEX definition)

(8..9) cp - Carrier phase measurement
   (8) double in hexadecimal notation
   (9) units: L1 cycles

(10..11) pr - Pseudorange measurement
    (10) double in hexadecimal notation
    (11) units: m

(12..13) do - Doppler measurement
    (12) double in hexadecimal notation
    (13) units: Hz

The second measurement block is on columns (14..23).
The Nth measurement block is on columns (4+10*(N-1)..13+10*(N-1)).
The last measurement block is on columns (494..503).
On each line, only the first numSV measurement blocks contain valid data.
